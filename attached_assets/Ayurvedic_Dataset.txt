Datasets Required for Ayurvedic Diet Management System
To build a comprehensive and intelligent Ayurvedic Diet Management & Nutrient Analysis software, multiple datasets will be needed. These datasets can be layered to create a robust and scalable solution.

1. Food & Nutritional Dataset (Base Layer)
Purpose: Serves as the foundation for nutrient calculations.
Contents: 
- Food name (English + regional names) 
- Category (cereal, pulse, vegetable, fruit, spice, oil, etc.) 
- Macronutrients (calories, protein, carbs, fat) 
- Micronutrients (vitamins & minerals) 
- Portion size/serving size 
- Preparation method (raw, boiled, fried)
Sources: Indian Food Composition Tables (IFCT), USDA FoodData Central, FSSAI packaged food data.

2. Ayurvedic Properties Dataset (Domain Layer)
Purpose: Makes the solution unique by adding Ayurvedic context.
Contents: 
- Rasa (taste): sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, astringent 
- Virya (potency): Ushna (heating) / Shita (cooling) 
- Vipaka (post-digestive effect) 
- Guna (qualities): light, heavy, oily, dry, etc. 
- Dosha impact: balances/aggravates Vata, Pitta, Kapha 
- Seasonal recommendations (if available)
Sources: Charaka Samhita, Ashtanga Hridaya, NCISM & CCRAS diet charts, validated Ayurvedic publications.

3. Recipe Dataset (Derived Layer)
Purpose: Supports dish-level planning and automated analysis.
Contents: 
- Recipe name 
- Ingredient list (linked to food database) 
- Preparation method - Nutrient breakdown (auto-calculated
- Ayurvedic profile (dominant rasa, dosha effect)
Sources: Open-source recipe datasets, Indian recipe websites, manual curation.

4. Patient & Lifestyle Dataset (Usage Layer)
Purpose: Enables personalization and tracking.
Contents: 
- Patient prakriti (body constitution) 
- Vikriti (current imbalance) 
- Health conditions, allergies, dislikes 
- Dietary preferences and frequency 
- Progress data (weight, BMI, symptoms) 
- Feedback and adherence
Sources: Captured dynamically through patient onboarding and follow-ups.

5. Seasonal & Regional Dataset (Context Layer)
Purpose: Adds contextual awareness to plans.
Contents: 
- Seasonal classification (6 Indian seasons) 
- Recommended/avoid foods for each season 
- Regional availability data
Sources: Ayurvedic seasonal routines (Ritucharya), regional food surveys.

6. Knowledge Base Dataset (Reasoning Layer)
Purpose: Enables explainable AI and education.
Contents: 
- Text excerpts from Ayurvedic texts
- Cause-effect mappings (e.g., symptom → dosha → diet advice) 
- Explanations for food selection
Sources: Digitized Ayurvedic texts, research papers, validated Ayurvedic experts’ notes.

7. Symptom-to-Diet Mapping Dataset (Future AI Layer)
Purpose: Powers semi-automatic dietary suggestions.
Contents:
 - Symptom mapping (acidity, bloating, insomnia, etc.) 
- Probable dosha imbalance 
- Recommended dietary adjustments 
- Ayurvedic justification
Sources: Clinical Ayurvedic case studies, practitioner input, public health datasets.

Summary:
The system will rely on a multi-layered dataset architecture: 
1.Nutritional data for scientific accuracy. 
2.Ayurvedic attributes for holistic context.
3.Recipes for real-world meal planning. 
4.Patient data for personalization. 
5. Seasonal/regional data for contextual relevance. 
6. Knowledge base for explainability. 
7. Symptom mapping for AI-driven recommendations.
