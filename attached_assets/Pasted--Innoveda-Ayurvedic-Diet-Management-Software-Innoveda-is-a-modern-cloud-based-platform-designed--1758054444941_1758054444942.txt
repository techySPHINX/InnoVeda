# Innoveda: Ayurvedic Diet Management Software

Innoveda is a modern, cloud-based platform designed for Ayurvedic practitioners to streamline diet planning and patient management. By integrating traditional Ayurvedic wisdom with modern nutritional science, Innoveda solves the key problems of manual inefficiency, lack of personalization, and poor patient compliance in dietary consultations.

## Key Features

*   **Smart Constitutional Assessment**: A quick digital questionnaire to help practitioners assess a patient's unique Ayurvedic body type (Prakriti) and current health imbalances (Vikriti).

*   **Intelligent Food Recommendations**: An extensive database of over 8,000 Indian and global food items, each mapped with both nutritional facts and crucial Ayurvedic properties like Rasa (taste), Virya (energy), and Vipaka (post-digestive impact).

*   **Personalized Meal Planning**: 
    *   Creates custom diet charts that dynamically adapt to weather changes, the patient's digestive capacity, and their current life stage.
    *   An AI-powered engine suggests optimal meals and daily routines (Dincharya) based on the patient's past preferences and recorded effectiveness.

*   **Patient Engagement Tools**: A patient-facing portal where they can log their meals, symptoms, and daily progress, while doctors monitor everything remotely to provide real-time guidance.

*   **Practice Management**: A complete, all-in-one solution for managing patient records, scheduling appointments, and tracking treatment history and outcomes.# User Profile Creation Flow (Patient's Perspective)

Based on the application's design, the user profile creation flow from the patient's (user's) side is simple and direct. The more complex steps like doctor verification and model retraining happen in the background without requiring the user's interaction.

From the patient's perspective, the flow is as follows:

1.  **Sign-Up & Quiz:** The user starts by filling out a registration form and a quiz with their personal details, such as age, gender, and lifestyle information.
2.  **Profile Creation:** Once the form is submitted, the system immediately processes this information, calculates metrics like BMI, predicts the user's Prakriti/Vikriti, and creates their profile.

Here is a simplified sequence diagram to illustrate the flow from the patient's viewpoint:
